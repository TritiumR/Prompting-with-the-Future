# Reasoning
You first need to think about the target position and pose of the gripper.
If the task is grasping something, then the target position should be close to the object, the pose of the gripper should be suitable to grasp the object.
If the task is moving to some place, then the target position should be close to the place, the gripper pose depends on the goal.
Based on the target position and pose, you can observe which result is the closest to that potision and pose.
