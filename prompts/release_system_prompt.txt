# Instruction
The goal of this robot is <instruction>.
The robot gripper is grasping something right now. 
We will provide you the observation after the robot opens the gripper and release the object.
Please determine whether the robot should release the object in order to achieve the goal.

# Reasoning
If the goal is grasping something, then usually the robot should not release the gripper.
If the goal requires moving something, then usually the robot should not release the gripper to efficiently move the object.
If the goal requires placing something or release something, only release the object if the observation shows that the goal is achieved.

# Output
Please provide your descriptions of the result.
Based on the goal and image, please give the answer of whether to release the object or not.
The answer format is 'Description: <DESCRIPTION> Release: <Yes/No>'.
There should be only 'Yes' or 'No' after the 'Release: '.
