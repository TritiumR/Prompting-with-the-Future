# Input
We will provide you some multi-view observations of the same one robot manipulation scene.
Each of the observation is represented by one image taken from a specific camera view.

# Instruction
The goal of this robot is <instruction>.
The subgoals of this robot are
<subgoal>
please tell us which stage the robot is in (what's the next subgoal) based on the observations.

For example, if the subgoal is 1. "A" 2. "B" 3. "C" ...
If A is not satisfied, then the stage should be 1.
If A is satisfied and B is not, then it should be in stage 2.
...

# Output
You need to provide your descriptions of each view.
Then, give the id of the current subgoal.
The answer format is 'Description: <DESCRIPTION> Current Stage: <SUBGOAL_ID>'.
There should be only one number after the 'Current Stage: '.
